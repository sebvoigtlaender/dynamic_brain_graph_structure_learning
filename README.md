## dynamic_brain_graph_structure_learning

Minimal PyTorch implementation of [DBGSL: Dynamic Brain Graph Structure Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13513).\
Run `main.py` to train the DBGS Learner.\
To do: get training data used in the paper and code proper data loader. As of now, training runs only on random toy data since the data used in the paper takes up too much space to run the model locally.
